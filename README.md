# Let's Keep IT Simple And Short
# Using pre-trained model for Deep Learning and Machine Learning projects and application is known as Transfer Learning.
The models that have been introduced below has been developed by Machine Learning And Deep Learning Experts for many years and have been performed as the state-of-the-art 
# HowToLoadPretrainedModels
# All the files that have been used here have been taken (and modified) from a free course on Deep Learning offered by Udacity (You can check it here - https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187)
In this,
You are going to learn how to load and use the state-of-the-art pre-trained models for your deep learning and machine learning projects or applications.
The models that you can use for your DL/ML projects or applications have been loaded from Tensorflow Pre-Trained Model hub. You can view them here - https://tfhub.dev/
The models that are included on Tensorflow Hub are :
